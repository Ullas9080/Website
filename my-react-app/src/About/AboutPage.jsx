                In the history of Karnataka, the name of Late Businayana
                Mukundadas Sreenivasaiah (BMS) occupies a prominent place in the
                field of Philanthropy. The Maharaja of Mysore honoured him with
                the title of Raja Karya Prasaktha in 1946. He started the B.M.S.
                College of Engineering in the same year. He had foreseen the
                urgent need for high quality technical education in India, even
                before independence. The ideals for which Sri. B. M.
                Sreenivasaiah stood, continued to inspire the inheritors of his
                legacy.
